								Operational momentum (OM) refers to the behavioral tendency to
								overestimate or underestimate the results of addition or subtraction,
								respectively. The cognitive mechanism of the OM effect and
								how it is related to the development of symbolic math abilities
								are not well understood. The current study examined whether
								individual differences in the OM effect are related to symbolic
								arithmetic abilities, number line estimation performance, and the
								space–magnitude association effect in young children. In this
								study, first-grade elementary school children manifested the OM
								effect during approximate addition and subtraction. Individual differences
								in the OM effect were not correlated with number line
								estimation error. Interestingly, children who showed a greater
								degree of the OM effect performed not worse, but better on the
								symbolic arithmetic task. In addition, the OM effect was correlated
								with the space–magnitude association (size congruity) effect measured
								with the Numerical Stroop task. More specifically, the OM
								bias was correlated with the ability to inhibit interference from
								competing information on the incongruent trials of the
								Numerical Stroop task. Our results suggest that the inaccuracy of
								numerical magnitude representations is not the source of the OM
								effect. Given that children with better math ability showed a
								greater OM bias, a stronger OM effect may reflect better intuition
								in arithmetic operations. Altogether, we carefully interpret these
								findings as suggesting that a greater OM effect reflects superior
								intuition or fundamental knowledge of arithmetic operations and a more adult-like maturation of the reorienting component of the
								attentional system.

								<h6>abstract</h6>
								Hemispheric asymmetries in arithmetic have been hypothesized based on neuropsychological, developmental,
								and neuroimaging work. However, it has been challenging to separate asymmetries related to arithmetic specifically,
								from those associated general cognitive or linguistic processes. Here we attempt to experimentally
								isolate the processing of numerical meaning in arithmetic problems from language and memory retrieval by
								employing novel non-symbolic addition problems, where participants estimated the sum of two dot arrays and
								judged whether a probe dot array was the correct sum of the first two arrays. Furthermore, we experimentally
								manipulated which hemisphere receive the probe array first using a visual half-field paradigm while recording
								event-related potentials (ERP). We find that neural sensitivity to numerical meaning in arithmetic arises under
								left but not right visual field presentation during early and middle portions of the late positive complex (LPC,
								400-800 ms). Furthermore, we find that subsequent accuracy for judgements of whether the probe is the correct
								sum is better under right visual field presentation than left, suggesting a left hemisphere advantage for integrating
								information for categorization or decision making related to arithmetic. Finally, neural signatures of
								operational momentum, or differential sensitivity to whether the probe was greater or less than the sum,
								occurred at a later portion of the LPC (800-1000 ms) and regardless of visual field of presentation, suggesting a
								temporal and functional dissociation between magnitude and ordinal processing in arithmetic. Together these
								results provide novel evidence for differences in timing and hemispheric lateralization for several cognitive
								processes involved in arithmetic thinking.

								<h6>abstract</h6>
								Approximate number sense (ANS) refers to the ability to approximately estimate and manipulate relatively large
								numerical quantity representations. An accurate ANS is hypothesized to facilitate a precise mapping between
								symbolic numbers and their corresponding magnitude and thereby can lead to an advantage in representing and
								working with symbolic numbers. This is referred to as the ANS mapping theory. ANS mapping is one of the
								mechanisms through which symbolic number meaning is thought to be learned. In the present study, we aimed
								to examine whether the mediating role of number-to-magnitude mapping precision differs depending on the
								domain of mathematics in adults and children. We found that mapping precision fully mediated the relationship
								between ANS acuity and math achievement in certain domains (Quantitative Reasoning in adults and Arithmetic
								in children). These results suggest that ANS acuity indirectly affects only certain domains of math achievement
								through its contribution to number-to-magnitude mapping precision, and that mapping precision differentially
								contributes to distinct domains of mathematics throughout development.

								<h6>abstract</h6>
								The goals of the present study were to test whether (and which) basic numerical abilities
								can be improved with training and whether training effects transfer to improvement
								in children’s math achievement. The literature is mixed with evidence that does or
								does not substantiate the efficacy of training basic numerical ability. In the present
								study, we developed a child-friendly software named “123 Bakery” which includes
								four training modules; non-symbolic numerosity comparison, non-symbolic numerosity
								estimation, approximate arithmetic, and symbol-to-numerosity mapping. Fifty-six first
								graders were randomly assigned to either the training or control group. The training
								group participated in 6 weeks of training (5 times a week, 30 minutes per day). All
								participants underwent pre- and post-training assessment of their basic numerical
								processing ability (including numerosity discrimination acuity, symbolic/non-symbolic
								magnitude estimation, approximate arithmetic, and symbol-to-numerosity mapping),
								overall math achievement and intelligence, 6 weeks apart. The acuity for numerosity
								discrimination (approximate number sense acuity; hereafter ANS acuity) significantly
								improved after training, but this training effect did not transfer to improvement in
								symbolic, exact calculation, or any other math ability. We conclude that basic numerical
								cognition training leads to improvement in ANS acuity, but whether this effect transfers
								to symbolic math ability remains to be further tested.

								<h6>abstract</h6>
								Approximate number sense (ANS) acuity refers to
								the ability to non-symbolically recognize, estimate and operate
								upon large numerosities. ANS acuity has been reported to
								be correlated with math achievement in children and adolescents.
								However, reports of this relationship in adults have been
								inconsistent. The present study aimed to resolve the inconsistency
								in the relationship between adults’ ANS acuity and math
								achievement by contrasting between different kinds of mathematical
								problem solving. We hypothesized that the correlation
								between ANS acuity mathematical performance would be
								stronger when deep quantitative processing is required during
								problem solving. In Experiment 1, ANS acuity was correlated
								with Mathematical Reasoning but not Directed Calculation
								performance. In Experiment 2, ANS acuity was correlated
								with Two-digit Subtraction (but not Addition) performance
								only when Regrouping (i.e., borrowing) was required. The
								results from two experiments demonstrated that ANS acuity
								was correlated with mathematical performance only
								when problem solving involved effortful, quantitative
								processing that goes beyond automatized, routinized arithmetic.
								In addition, ANS acuity was distinguishable
								from Area acuity regarding its unique relationship with
								math achievement, which was unconfounded by the influence
								of demographic variables and fluid intelligence.
								Overall, the present results help resolve the inconsistency in
								previous reports of the correlation between ANS acuity and
								math achievement in adults.

								<h6>abstract</h6>
								Approximate number sense (ANS) refers to the ability to approximately estimate and
								operate upon large numerosity. There have been reports on the correlation between ANS
								acuity and mathematical achievement supporting the hypothesis that ANS serves as a
								basic foundation for formal mathematical achievement. However, previous developmental
								studies mainly focused on ‘Number Concept’ and ‘Arithmetic’ scores and did not
								differentiate between different domains of mathematics. Therefore, the current study
								investigated whether the relationship between ANS acuity and math ability differs by the
								domain of mathematics. In addition, we aimed to test the argument raised by some
								researchers stating that the relationship between ANS acuity and mathematical
								achievement is entirely mediated by cognitive control ability. Second graders were tested
								twice on their ANS acuity and math achievement with a 3-month interval. A number
								comparison task using a pair of dot arrays was used to measure ANS acuity. ANS acuity
								was significantly correlated with ‘Number Concept & Arithmetic’ at both testing periods.
								‘Geometry’ was significantly correlated with ANS acuity in the second testing session but
								not in the first. On the other hand, ANS measured under high requirement for cognitive
								control did not correlate with any measure of math achievement. These results
								demonstrate that the correlation between ANS and math achievement can be generalized
								to mathematical domains including ‘Number Concept’, ‘Arithmetic’ and ‘Geometry’.
								Furthermore, the relationship between ANS acuity and mathematical achievement does
								not seem to be mediated by cognitive control ability in any domain of mathematics.

								<h6>abstract</h6>
								Mathematics Anxiety (MA) has a negative impact on mathematical learning. In order to develop diagnostic tools and intervention programs for MA, we first need to understand the factors underlying MA. Previous MA studies conducted in South Korea only dealt with subdomains of MA measured from elementary to high school students. However, considering that the context in which college students experience MA differs from younger students, it is important to include measurements of MA in relation to decisions about jobs, higher degrees or personal finance. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a MA rating scale for Korean college students. To develop this scale, we included previously proposed factors of MA such as test or learning anxiety, along with additional factors tailored to college students. From an initial survey measuring diverse aspects of MA, 4 main factors and 20 items were derived by an exploratory factor analysis and a reliability analysis. Next, we examined the validity of this scale by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis. The factors were properties of math: abstraction and language, lack of confidence in math, math test anxiety and math learning anxiety. Female students had higher MA than males. Participants majoring in humanities and Social Sciences showed greater MA than those majoring in engineering and natural sciences. This research provides the first validated scale of MA that can be administered to Korean college students.
